Certainly. Word embeddings are a type of word representation that transform textual tokens — what we think of as words — into vectors in a numerical space. These vectors capture a lot of the semantics, or the meaning, of a word in their dimensions; words that occur in similar contexts in the text corpus will be closer in the numerical space, which allows us to understand some of the relationships among words.

In the context of semantic search, these embeddings are critical because they enable the search engine to find responses that are semantically close to the query’s meaning, instead of requiring an exact lexical match. So, for instance, if you're searching for "automobile," a semantic search could also retrieve documents containing "car" or "vehicle" which are semantically related.
